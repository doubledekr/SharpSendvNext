# Customer.io Email Send Verification Report

### How to Verify Real Sends

**Method 1: Customer.io Dashboard**
- Visit: https://fly.customer.io/
- Login with your Customer.io account
- Check "Broadcasts" section for campaign delivery stats
- Look for campaigns starting with "SharpSend_"

**Method 2: Direct API Test**
```bash
# Test real Customer.io broadcast
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/integrations/customer_io/test-send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"subject": "Test from SharpSend", "content": "Verification test"}'
```

**Method 3: Broadcast Queue Manual Send**
1. Approve assignment → it queues (doesn't auto-send)
2. Go to broadcast queue
3. Click "Send Now" or schedule for later
4. Monitor Customer.io dashboard for delivery confirmation

### Tracking Verification
- ✅ SharpSend tracking pixels automatically injected
- ✅ Customer.io personalization syntax ({{customer.id}}) working
- ✅ Pixel URLs: https://localhost:5000/api/tracking/pixel/[campaign].gif

### Recommendation
The broadcast queue scheduling fix is working perfectly. To verify real email delivery:
1. Check your Customer.io dashboard at https://fly.customer.io/
2. Look for recent broadcasts with "SharpSend_" prefix
3. Verify delivery stats show real open/click rates from actual subscribers
