Your deployment attempt had the following errors:
Server exits with code 0 immediately after initialization completing all startup tasks including database seeding in server/index.ts
Process completes the async IIFE function and terminates normally instead of staying alive to handle requests
Health check endpoint becomes unavailable after server exits, causing deployment health check failures
An error occurred while loading AI generated suggestions. Please try deploying again or follow the common debugging steps. Common issues for promote stage errors can be an error occurring while trying to run your run command, your application exiting unexpectedly, an error on your app server or a provisioning issue.
