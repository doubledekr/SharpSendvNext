Perfect—let’s keep Assignment lean but add image placement so a copywriter can deliver a truly “production-ready” master. Below is a minimal, email-safe design you can ship quickly, plus the exact fields, UI, and HTML you’ll need.
1) What to add (minimal, copywriter-friendly)
A) Image Block (insert anywhere in the draft)
Each Image block has just 5 controls:
Choose/Upload (from Asset Library or local upload)
Alt text (required)
Caption (optional; supports “Source/Credit”)
Alignment: Left • Center • Right
Size: Full (600px) • Half (288px) • Thumb (150px)
That’s it. No filters, no complex editing. Cropping/compression happen server-side.
B) Lightweight Asset Library
Shows recently uploaded images for the assignment.
Each asset stores: url, width/height, filesize_kb, credit, license.
Prevent external hotlinking (host on your CDN), auto-convert unsupported types (e.g., WEBP → JPEG) for email.
C) Editor Buttons
/image slash command or “Insert Image” button (opens Asset Library / Upload).
Replace, Edit alt, Align, Size, Remove (inline toolbar on selected image).
Autosave every 10s; warn on unsaved changes before leaving.
2) Email-safe output (so marketing can reuse without breakage)
Most email clients still prefer table-based layouts. When a copywriter inserts an image, serialize to an email-safe block like this:
<!-- IMAGE BLOCK: center, full width -->
<table role="presentation" width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td align="center" style="padding:16px 0;">
      <img src="https://cdn.example.com/assets/abc123.jpg"
           alt="A simple chart showing dividend yields by sector"
           width="600"
           style="display:block;width:100%;max-width:600px;height:auto;border:0;outline:none;text-decoration:none;">
      <!-- Optional caption -->
      <p style="margin:8px 0 0 0;font:12px/1.4 Arial, sans-serif;color:#666;">
        Dividend yields by sector — Source: Publisher Research
      </p>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
Left/Right align just changes align="left|right" and applies a fixed width (e.g., 288) with padding on the opposite side.
Half/Thumb change width and max-width to 288 or 150 respectively.
Plain-text fallback (auto-generated):
[Image: Dividend yields by sector — Source: Publisher Research]
https://cdn.example.com/assets/abc123.jpg
3) Minimal data model additions
Assignment (add image placements to the master draft)
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "String",
  "status": "draft|in_progress|review",
  "assignee_id": "user_id",
  "due_at": "ISO8601",
  "brief": { "objective": "String", "angle": "String", "key_points": ["String"], "offer": {"label":"String","url":"String|null"}, "references": ["URL"] },
  "assets": [
    {"asset_id":"uuid","url":"https://cdn/.../abc123.jpg","credit":"String","license":"String","w":1200,"h":800,"filesize_kb":142}
  ],
  "master_draft": {
    "blocks": [
      {"type":"paragraph","md":"Intro paragraph …"},
      {"type":"image","asset_id":"uuid","alt":"Dividend yields…","caption":"Dividend yields by sector — Source: Publisher Research","align":"center","size":"full"},
      {"type":"paragraph","md":"Body text continues …"}
    ]
  }
}
Marketers/publishers will later promote this Assignment into a Draft. Your Drafts workspace can render these same blocks but with more controls (A/B, segmentation, schedule).
4) Upload & transform pipeline (tiny but robust)
POST /assets accepts JPG/PNG/GIF/WEBP.
Server:
Convert to JPG/PNG for email compatibility (keep quality).
Generate sizes: 600 (full), 288 (half), 150 (thumb).
Compress to keep < 200KB per image when possible.
Store url, w, h, filesize_kb, credit, license.
Return asset_id and the canonical email size URL (600px) for insertion.
5) Validation & guardrails (copywriter-side)
Alt text required for every Image block (can’t mark “Ready for Review” without it).
Max image count (e.g., 6 per email) to keep weight down.
Width presets only (600 / 288 / 150) — no arbitrary scaling (keeps emails tidy).
Auto-caption pattern (optional): if credit exists, prefill caption = "… — Source: {credit}".
Dark-mode safety toggle (optional): add a 1px light outline around very dark logos.
6) Tiny UI spec (drop-in)
Insert Image Modal
Tabs: Upload | Library
Asset card shows thumbnail + filename + credit; click to select
Fields on select: Alt (required), Caption (optional), Alignment, Size → Insert
Inline Image Toolbar (on select)
Replace | Alt | Align | Size | Remove
Checklist (right rail)
 At least 1 key point
 CTA URL present (or “none”)
 No more than 6 images
 All images have alt text ✅
Buttons
Save Draft (autosave on)
Ready for Review (enforces checks)
Promote to Draft (hands off to marketers)
7) How this plays with AI (later, no extra UI today)
Marketers in Drafts can run AI Variations; your serializer keeps <img> blocks intact.
Optional: AI can suggest alt text or caption when missing—but Assignment still requires manual confirmation.
8) Acceptance criteria (ship list)
Can insert, align (L/C/R), and size (Full/Half/Thumb) an image in Assignment.
Alt text is required before “Ready for Review”.
Image renders in a table-based email-safe block with width attributes.
Plain-text alternative includes [Image: …] line and the URL.
Upload converts non-email-friendly formats and constrains file size.
