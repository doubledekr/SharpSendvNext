ot it ✅ — this is where SharpSend’s “performance brain” comes alive. Right now, your onboarding flow and dashboard are clean, but we need to layer in the pixel + automation modules so that:
Every email = auto-attached SharpSend Pixel (with confirmation).
Dashboard surfaces Pixel Insights (open rates, device/location breakdown, engagement curves).
Email Fatigue Detector shows if subscribers are burning out (too many touches).
Auto-Segmentation Engine continuously suggests new list splits (based on behavior, sentiment, fatigue).
Market Sentiment + News Feed drives proactive send opportunities (e.g., VIX spikes, Fed news).
🔍 Updated Dashboard Modules
1. Pixel Manager
Auto Pixel Attachment → every send gets a unique SharpSend pixel.
Pixel Confirmation UI → a small checkmark/tag per draft to show it’s attached.
Advanced Pixel Customization (Pro Tier+):
Name/tag pixels (e.g., Promo Campaign 7/18).
Track by campaign, segment, or publication.
Create rules: “If Pixel shows <15% open after 24h, resend variant B.”
2. Performance & Fatigue
Email Fatigue Detector:
Alerts: “Segment A has dropped open rates by 30% in 2 weeks → reduce touch frequency.”
Suggests “cool-off” automations.
Engagement Heatmaps (pixel-driven):
Time-of-day activity.
Device usage.
“Hot” and “cold” segments.
3. Auto Segmentation Engine
Looks at pixel + ESP data.
Suggests micro-segments:
“High CTR but low conversion”
“Clicked on premium offers 3x but never converted”
“Always opens bullish market sentiment headlines.”
One-click: “Adopt Segment → Generate Targeted Campaign.”
4. Market Sentiment & News Feed
VIX Index Integration:
Shows fear/greed sentiment meter.
Suggests campaigns (e.g., “VIX up → bearish subject lines tested well in your sector”).
Finance News API Pull (NA region only, for now):
SharpSend proposes content hooks:
“Fed raises rates today → Consider alert campaign to Premium subscribers.”
“Tech stocks rally → Marketing email idea: Ride the wave with portfolio pitch.”
5. Unified Dashboard Layout
Instead of scattered tools, one clean dashboard view:
📊 Dashboard Tabs:
Performance (Pixel) → Open %, CTR, Conversion
Fatigue Alerts → Health meter for each segment
Opportunities (News + Sentiment) → Suggested campaigns
Segments → Auto-detected + manual ones
Pixel Library → Manage/edit/review all past pixels tied to campaigns
👉 This keeps SharpSend from being “just another email AI” — it feels like a command center for publishers: proactive, data-backed, and visual.
